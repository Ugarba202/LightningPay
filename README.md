# ⚡ LightningPay

LightningPay is a **production-structured mobile application** built with **Flutter**, **Python (FastAPI)**, and **Bitcoin Lightning Network** technologies.


---

## 🚀 Vision

The goal of LightningPay is to demonstrate how a modern mobile application is built **end-to-end**, using clean code, scalable architecture, and industry best practices.

Rather than jumping straight into complex Bitcoin logic, the app evolves gradually:

1. Beautiful, professional Flutter UI
2. Clean app logic and state management
3. Python backend with real APIs
4. Bitcoin & Lightning Network integration

This approach mirrors how real production applications are developed.

---

## 🧩 Problem

* Many developers learn Flutter UI but struggle to connect it to real backends.
* Bitcoin and Lightning concepts are often taught theoretically, without real applications.
* There is a lack of **clean, review-ready sample projects** that combine mobile, backend, and Bitcoin technologies.

---

## 💡 Solution

LightningPay solves this by providing:

* A **feature-based Flutter architecture**
* A real **Python (FastAPI) backend**
* Practical **Bitcoin & Lightning payment flows**
* Clean, readable, and review-friendly code
* A transparent build-in-public learning process
